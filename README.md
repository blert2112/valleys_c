support code for the Valleys C++ mapgen

https://github.com/duane-r/valleys_c

This mod exists to support the C++ version of Valleys Mapgen for
Minetest, written by Duane Robertson as a port of Gael-de-Sailly's
lua-based mapgen. (https://github.com/duane-r/minetest/tree/valleys_c)

The goal of the combined project is not to replicate Valleys Mapgen,
but to use the remarkable algorithms Gael-de-Sailly created to make
a more traditional mapgen, compatible with the standard Minetest
systems (such as biomes and decorations).

## Changelog
20151003 Moved the code to a separate repository, since it no longer
          shares any lua files with the original.

20150922 Copied my working files up. It's a mess.
